get_next_line - File Reading Function | 42 Academy | Score: 125/100 | Completed: May 29th, 2024.

üìã Project Overview

get_next_line is a crucial 42 Academy project that introduces advanced concepts of static variables, file descriptors, and efficient memory management while handling dynamic buffer allocation.
Challenge: Read and return one line at a time from a file descriptor, managing memory efficiently with static variables and handling edge cases like varying buffer sizes, empty lines, and large files.  

üîß **Key Technical Skills Developed**

- Static Variables: Mastering persistent data storage between function calls without global variables
- File Descriptor Management: Working with system-level file operations and read() function
- Dynamic Memory Management: Efficient buffer allocation and reallocation strategies
- String Manipulation: Advanced string joining and line extraction techniques
- Memory Leak Prevention: Proper cleanup of static variables and dynamic allocations
- Edge Case Mastery: Managing EOF, empty files, single characters, and massive lines
- Algorithmic Thinking: Designing efficient line-by-line reading without reading entire files

üöÄ **Learning Outcomes**

- System Programming: Deep understanding of file I/O operations at system level
- Memory Optimization: Balancing memory usage with performance for large file processing
- Research Methodology: Learning to compare multiple implementations and choosing optimal solutions

üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Specifications**
